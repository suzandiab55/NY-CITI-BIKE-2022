# NY-CITI-BIKE-2022
## Objective 
The NY-CITI-BIKE-2022 project aims to analyze Citi Bike usage in New York City for the year 2022. By leveraging data visualization tools and APIs, the project seeks to uncover trends, user behavior, and usage patterns to enhance urban mobility planning and bike sharing system efficiency.
## Data
The dataset includes detailed records of Citi Bike rides for the year 2022, provided through the Citi Bike API. Key parameters include:

- Trip durations
- Start and end stations
- User types (Subscriber or Customer)
- Start and end times
- Geospatial coordinates of bike stations
##Tools
For this project, various tools and libraries were utilized:

- Python for data manipulation and analysis
- Pandas & NumPy for data structuring and numerical operations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for creating static charts
- Plotly & Dash for interactive data visualizations and dashboard creation
- Folium for advanced geospatial plotting
## Extra Resources
The interactive dashboard of Citi Bike usage can be accessed [here](https://suzandiab55-ny-citi-bike-2022-st-dashboard2-fqfy75.streamlit.app/).

## Key Insights
- Peak usage times and patterns across different user types
- Station traffic hotspots and their impact on bike availability
- Rider trends that could inform future improvements in bike distribution and station locations
## Data Cleaning Procedures
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data using Python's pandas library
- Handled missing values, outliers, and errors in geospatial data
- Standardized the format of timestamps and geographical coordinates
## Code
All code and detailed analysis procedures are documented in Jupyter Notebooks within this repository, allowing for full reproducibility and further exploration of the data.
